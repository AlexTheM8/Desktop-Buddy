# Desktop Buddy
This is a project that I worked on ages ago for fun. Might improve it later.

## How To Use
The Desktop Buddy has two supported characters: Kirby (from the Kirby series) and Boney (from Mother 3).

First, clone this Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexTheM8/Desktop-Buddy.git
```

Navigate into the cloned folder and install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the Kirby Desktop Buddy, execute the following command:

```
python buddy.py
```

To run the Boney Desktop Buddy, execute the following command:

```
python buddy_boney.py
```

To stop the Desktop Buddy, close the command terminal.
